### Parts Inventory App using Typescript + Webpack

An inventory for part application (nothing new here, I seem to have many ðŸ˜…)...This project differs in that it's my first time using Typescript and Webpack. What a great combo! ..and a huge relief from
me having to deal with all of the import, exports, script tags, etc...that's where all of the headaches come from IMO. This is just the starting code, after I've learned more about Webpack and Typescript I'll 
be adding a lot more features to this project...I especially want to learn more about TypeScript's type system and how to use it to create more robust applications.
