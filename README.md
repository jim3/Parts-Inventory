### Parts Inventory App using Typescript + Webpack

An inventory for parts application (nothing new here, I seem to have many 😅)...This project differs in that it's my first time using Typescript and Webpack. What a great combo! ..and a huge relief from
me having to deal with all of the import, exports, script tags, etc...that's where all of the headaches come from IMO.

This is just the starting code, after I've learned more about Webpack I'll be adding a lot more features to this project...TypeScript's type system is also an interest, would like to learn how to use it to create more robust applications.
